# The Rust Programming Language 🦀

This repository contains my notes and code while following *The Rust Programming Language* book.

I’m working through the book cover to cover from time to time and testing things as I go. I run the examples, change them, and poke at edge cases to see how Rust behaves.

## What’s in this repo

- Code examples from the book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
- Small experiments based on the guide
- Notes and comments added while learning

## Goal

Use the Rust book as a reference and verify each concept by running and changing the code.
